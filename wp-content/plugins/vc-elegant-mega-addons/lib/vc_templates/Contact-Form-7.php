[vc_row][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_text_separator title="Easy Contact Form 7 Selector"][vc_column_text]WordPress started in 2003 with a single bit of code to enhance the typography of everyday writing and with fewer users than you can count on your fingers and toes. Since then it has grown to be the largest self-hosted blogging tool in the world, used on millions of sites and seen by tens of millions of people every day.

Everything you see here, from the documentation to the code itself, was created by and for the community. WordPress is an Open Source project, which means there are hundreds of people all over the world working on it. (More than most commercial platforms.) It also means you are free to use it for anything from your recipe site to a Fortune 500 web site without paying anyone a license fee and a number of other important freedoms.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_text_separator title="Contact Form 7 Selector"][vcmp_contactform7 id="58"][/vc_column][/vc_row]
